## Purpose and Inspiration
Occasionally I peruse through several gaming websites such as Destructoid, Siliconera, and Polygon. Kinda miffed with how many sites I had to open at once, I developed this site back in 2019 to roll all the updates from those sites into one. 

My inspiration for this site also came from a college friend of mine who was creating a similar aggregator for 100 Days of Code using a subbredit called r/hiphopheads for content. Shoutouts to you, Aaron!

*UPDATE*: I've since revisited this project to recreate it in React and TypeScript.

**Basic Functions**
* Languages/Libraries Used: React, Typescript, Tailwind, Feednami
* Provide links to various articles related to gaming (a la HackerNews), but personally curated (thus, not a forum)
* Grab articles from multiple popular VG sites (Destructoid, Rock Paper Shotgun, Game Informer) and lesser knowns (Siliconera, Eurogamer)
* Should load content from the past week (to keep things minimalistic)
